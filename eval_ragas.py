"""
RAGAS Evaluation Script for the Career Chatbot RAG Pipeline.

Queries the live chatbot API, collects answers + retrieved contexts,
then evaluates with RAGAS metrics:
  - Faithfulness: Are factual claims grounded in retrieved context?
  - Answer Relevancy: Does the answer address the question?
  - Context Precision: Are retrieved chunks relevant?
  - Context Recall: Were the right chunks retrieved?

    },
    {
        "question": "What is his AI and ML experience?",
        "reference": "Tiago has experience with RAG pipelines (LangChain, ChromaDB, fastembed), LLM integration (Groq API, structured output), multimodal AI classification (Llama 3.2 11B Vision for road damage images), YOLOv8 object detection for his MSc thesis on road surface hazard detection, and prompt engineering for production systems.",
    },
    {
        "question": "Tell me about his MSc thesis",
        "reference": "Tiago's MSc thesis is titled 'Expert System for Road Surface Hazard Detection'. It presents a modular two-component pipeline: a YOLOv8 object detection model identifies road defects from images, and a deterministic rule-based expert system assigns maintenance priority levels (Low/Medium/High). Best result: mAP50 of 0.663 with YOLOv8s. Post-processing reduced noisy detections by 31.2%. Submitted February 2026 at University of Europe for Applied Sciences, Berlin.",
    },
    {
        "question": "Why is he interested in FIDgate?",
        "reference": "Three reasons: (1) the domain — Tiago originally studied renewable energy during his mechanical engineering degree; (2) the level of ownership — he wants to own real problems end to end, not just implement tickets; (3) the problem itself — replacing manual Excel-based energy decisions with autonomous optimization systems, which is technically challenging and has real-world impact.",
    },
    {
        "question": "How would he turn an API into a developer platform?",
        "reference": "First talk to early adopters to understand friction. Then focus on three areas: (1) API design — clear versioning, predictable response structures, meaningful error handling; (2) Developer experience — documentation based on real workflows, not just endpoints; (3) Reliability — rate limiting, monitoring, clear latency/uptime expectations. Plus an AI layer for interpretability.",
    },
    {
        "question": "Tell me about Odys",
        "reference": "Odys is a WhatsApp-first SaaS platform built entirely solo for Brazilian freelance professionals. It features self-service booking pages, automated WhatsApp reminders from the professional's own number via self-hosted Evolution API, Stripe payments with PIX, multi-tenant architecture, and Supabase pg_cron for scheduled tasks. It's live in production but Tiago hasn't focused on distribution yet.",
    },
    {
        "question": "What would he do in his first 30 days at FIDgate?",
        "reference": "Understanding before building, but not passively. Go deep into the decision engine, current API, and how it's being used — run it locally, explore edge cases, try to break it. In parallel, talk to early adopters to understand friction. Identify one or two high-impact improvements and start implementing before end of first month.",
    },
    {
        "question": "How many users does Odys have?",
        "reference": "Odys is live in production but Tiago hasn't focused on distribution yet, so there is no meaningful user traction to claim. His priority has been building the product and validating core workflows technically before pushing for growth.",
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the limitations of RAG systems?",
        "reference": "Four main limitations: (1) Retrieval quality — if relevant context isn't retrieved, the answer fails; (2) Hallucinations — even with right context, the model can generate incorrect responses; (3) Latency and cost at scale; (4) Evaluation is hard without labeled ground truth.",
    },
    {
        "question": "What does founder-level ownership mean to him?",
        "reference": "It means not waiting to be told where the problem is. Understanding the user, identifying what matters most, making decisions with incomplete information, and taking responsibility for the outcome — not just the implementation. Thinking beyond the code and treating the product as something you are fully accountable for.",
